# Cloud Resume with Azure Storage Account

In this project, I created a cloud-hosted resume using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills and experiences. The website was deployed to an Azure Storage Account as a static website, leveraging Azure's ability to serve content directly from blob storage.

The website is designed to be clean, responsive, and modern, featuring sections for my professional summary, certifications, education, work experience, and cloud projects. It also includes an interactive visitor counter that updates dynamically using JavaScript, with the visitor count stored in Azure Table Storage via an Azure Function.

The project helped me learn:

Azure Storage Account for static website hosting.
HTML & CSS for web design and layout.
JavaScript for dynamic elements and integrating with Azure services.
Azure Table Storage and Azure Functions for storing and retrieving data.
Deployment and configuration in Azure, including setting up the storage account, enabling static website hosting, and integrating functions for dynamic content.
This project demonstrates my ability to build, deploy, and maintain cloud-based applications using Azure services.
